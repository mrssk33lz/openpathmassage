    <p>Currently I offer In-Home Massage sessions with affordable rates while bringing a sense of relaxation and calm to your home. It's so very important for me to offer modalities that can help your body heal, or relax and refresh the body from a stressful week or busy weekend. I have a diverse range of techniques to help soothe sore muscles, incorporate stretches to improve your range of motion and de-stress your mind and wellbeing. Life can be stressful for everyone on a daily basis and I want to bring massage to you so that it's beneficial, affordable and effective. Man or Woman, massage can be for anyone such as those who work on computers, stand all day jobs and have tired feet, or manual laborers with low back issues and hip problems. See my Benefits page for more information.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to Contact Me for more information on what massage can help you, or to schedule a Massage with me in your home. I can travel within the southern Berks, southern Montgomery and most of Chester Counties. I provide music, aromatherapy, the table, linens and lotion/oil. I only need a room or space to allow for the table and myself to work around you.</p>
    <p>A regular commitment of a frequent massage will help to alleviate Knots, Trigger Points, Piriformis Syndrome, Sciatic Nerve Impingement, or Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. Sedentary careers can create problems such as forearm and carpel tunnel issues, tight hamstrings and quads, stiff neck and limited range of motion, mid and low back discomfort due to poor office chair use/equipment, and stressful long commutes. With massage these conditions can be resolved or managed so you can feel relief. Physically active careers also come with there share of pain and discomfort and greater risk for injury if work is not performed properly. In this economy Massage is essential for a better wellbeing and I want to make sure I can help no matter what your budget is. Please Contact Me for more pricing details specific to your needs.</p>
