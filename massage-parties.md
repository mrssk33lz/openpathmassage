    <p>I offer Massage Parties for those who love massages, or those who are new to massage and would like a way to be introduced in a way that is comfortable, affordable and relaxing. I also bring my massage chair to your event whether a Wedding Party Day, Ladies Night In, Corporate In Office Visits, or gatherings such as an Open House for your place of business.</p>
    <p>In home Massage Parties can range from 6-10 people per massage therapist, offering relaxation and energizing massage.</p>
    <p>I have a small team of Massage Therapists also available for larger parties of 15 people and more. It is recommended to have a free room available to setup my chair, which is much smaller than setting up my massage table. Massage table parties available upon request!</p>
